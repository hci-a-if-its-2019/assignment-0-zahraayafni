## USB Flash drive V-GEN

![alt text](http://https://github.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-zahraayafni/assets/fd.JPG)

### Problem
My usb flash drive have a bad design on its USB connector. The connector is located inside the flash drive body, thus we have to take that out by wiping the red button on the left side of the body (I'll show you how to use my usb flash drive on the attached video). Sometimes when my hands feel moist, it'll be harder to wipe the red button. This is slightly annoy me because it'll takes more time to connect my flash drive to the laptop/PC. 

### Solution
I think the solution for this problem is changing the usb flash drive model. As far as i know, there are so many kind of usb flash drive which have a better design on its connector. Absolutely, we don't have to wipe anything. We only give some efforts on pushing the tail of the flash drive to connect with laptop/PC.

## Heehjek, A Mobile Apps for Ordering _Ojek_ in Nganjuk

![alt text](http://https://github.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-zahraayafni/assets/heehjek.JPG)

Heehjek is an online platform for ordering _ojek_ in Nganjuk, my hometown. This is a kind of _Gojek_ or _Grab_ application.

### Problem
I found some bad UX design on this apps. As we can see in the above image, there's a button named "NGLADENI". At first, i don't get the purpose of this button. I live in Nganjuk about 9 years, but still can't reach the aim of this button. Then, i try to hit this button and found a list of menu that offer some services like event organizer for a party, Photo and video documentation, etc. But, they didn't give more information about how this service work, no explanation for the packages that offered but there are options for the packages. In addition, we have to hit the 'Pilihan Varian Layanan' bar 3 times to pop up the options that offered, but still there are no more information for each package. I still continued my journey on this application until the order process finished. But, i'm as a user for this apps feeling upset because i don't know what to do with the ordered service. 

### Solution
For the first case of this problem, we have to choose a familiar word to represent our menu. So that our user can get the use of a button at one time. Next, i would like to suggest the developer for this apps to add more details or information for each service and package listed. If they're not ready yet to run this service (i mean this 'NGLADENI' button), they can make a pop up when this button on pressed and say something like "Sorry, this service is not ready yet. We will announce you when this feature is ready". This is more better than forcing to run a feature, but it will upsetting our user in near future.

## Share ITS Website Application

![alt text](http://https://github.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-zahraayafni/assets/shareits.JPG)

[Share ITS](http://share.its.ac.id/) is one of the online learning platform for ITS students. 

### Problem
Let's begin this problem with a short story! :smiley:
I have a friend, her name is Dyah. She is from Urban and Regional Planning Department of ITS. We know that ITS have been turned into a PTN-BH, this been a reason why FTSP(Fakultas Teknologi Sipil dan Perencanaan) was splitted into FTSLK(Fakultas Teknologi Sipil, Lingkungan, dan Kebumian) and FADP(Fakultas Arsitektur, Desain, dan Perencanaan). Formerly, my friend's department is belong to be part of FTSP. But then changed into FTSLK.

When she's trying to reach her course on Share ITS, she can't found her faculty on ShareITS's landing page grid button. As shown in the above picture, there's only exist FTSP which is her former faculty. There are no button for FADP nor FTSLK, but FBMT and Fvokasi is exist. My friend is getting confused, then she is trying to find her faculty/course by pressing the FTSP button. And again, this button doesn't take my friend to the splitted faculty. But it landed on FTSLK page (a list of departments in FTSLK), which is not belong to FTSP anymore. Then, she's trying to find her course manually on its navigation bar, by hit the menu one by one. 

I think this is a kind of bad design for web application, as a result of inconsistency of the menu that provided. I mean for the menu on navigation bar have been arranged as the new faculty policy after PTN-BH. But the grid button of its landing page, not doing so.

### Solution
I would like to say that this web application needs to be upgraded and doing more check of all the menus that provided. Keep the consistency of menu will make nobody confuse, otherwise we will have a long journey to find the menu that we want.
